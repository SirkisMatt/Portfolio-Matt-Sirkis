                <h2>Campsite to Website</h2> 
                <p>Hey, my name is Matt Sirkis. I am a software developer based out of San Diego, CA. Bridging the gap between the tech world and the natural world is a great passion of mine.</p>
                <p>As a former environmental educator I have gained a deep appreciation for the human impacts on our planets natural systems.
                    I am moving into the role of a software engineer so that I can help bring tech into the fight against human and environmental injustices.
                </p>
                <p>I believe conservation technology should be accessible to not only researchers but to everyone that is interested in discovering the nuances of Earths biosphere. 
                </p>

                    <h2>Fireside Chat</h2>
                    <p>After my studies at University, I traveled the country working as an environmental educator. I enjoyed that path in life but I always felt there was something more I could do to contribute to humanity.
                    I was inspired to become a software developer when I started looking into conservation technology. </p>
                    <p> I plan on bringing my tech skills to the fight against climate change. 
                    If you are looking for a passionate software developer, please reach out! I am very excited to work with others on great software and tech that has environmental stewardship at its heart. </p>
