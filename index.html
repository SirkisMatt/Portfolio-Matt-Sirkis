            <p>Hey, my name is Matt Sirkis. I am a software developer based out of San Diego, CA! Bridging the gap between the tech world and the natural world is a great passion of mine.</p>
            <p>As a former environmental educator, these are some things I'm interested in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bringing tech into the fight against human and environmental injustices.</li>
                <li>Conservation technology.</li>
                <li>Apps that help people conduct citizen science.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thank you for taking a look at my website! Feel free to <a href="#contact">contact me!</a></p>

            <p>After my studies at University, I traveled the country working as an environmental educator. 
            I have always been fascinated by the role technology has played in conservation.</p>
            <p>As a student at Bloc, I am on my way to becoming a software developer. I plan on bringing my tech skills to the fight against climate change.</p>
            <p>If you are looking for a passionate software developer, please reach out! I am very excited to work with others on great software and tech that has environmental stewardship at its heart. </p>
